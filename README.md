# Exploring Actions
This Repo is for learning Github actions and contains some workflows which test out a variety of different aspects
Course Used: [KodeKloud - Github Actions](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/github-actions)

# Course critiques:
- During Triggering a workflow, it is noted by the instructor that the cron scheduling workflow trigger doesn't work and they just move on (will change if this is answered later) The rest of the course is fine
- He also sometimes copies in a large workflow, which could be annoying, especially when typing out repeatsed content. I was not able to find a repo that contains all of the workflows (try to find)
